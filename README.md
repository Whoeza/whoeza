Special thanks to:
- [@NicknameAlwaysTaken](https://github.com/NicknameAlwaystaken) for sharing the idea about GitHub sponsors.

I could not believe the day I had my first sponsor here on GitHub! Here's my page: [github.com/sponsors/Whoeza](https://github.com/sponsors/Whoeza/)


## **ðŸ‘‹ Hello!**

My latest contribution is called [Source and license](https://github.com/Whoeza/source_and_license) and it allows to write a universal license header at the top of all your source code files.

### Collaboration and hiring

If you have a small repository that I can help maintain, or a small feature that I could develop for you, don't hesitate to DM me. I am up for challenges.

Website under construction! Be patient... (: [whoeza.github.io](https://whoeza.github.io)
