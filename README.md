**Hi there 👋 I want to become a Software Engineer 💻👑**
## My personal roadmap
* I'm currently learning 🌎 Web Development on freeCodeCamp
  * The idea is to start at 1️⃣ Frontend development
  * move on with 🎯 Backend development
  * and finish up with the Web as a ☝ Full Stack Development
## Past experiences
* I had fun coding GTA V mods in FiveM for 2 months (until my PC burned down to hell 🔥)
* I started learning Python to learn Data Science
* I re-focused multiple times on various ideas and projects, until I decided:
  * > ## *Let's finish* **one** *project, before moving onto the next one*
 
Which brought me to my first and latest project, *Web\* Development*.
