**Hello! ðŸ‘‹** I am an engineering student with a full-time job, studying part-time to get my degree in computer science and information engineering.

I am struggling to get a job in software engineering because of my background which does not include much work experience in software despite my academic preparation.
I write in here to let you know that I would be available and willing to volunteer for open source projects, with particular interest in API's, JavaScript, React, Python, Lisp, Java, Lua, PHP, C, C++, C#.
If you have a small repository that I can help maintain, or a small feature that I could develop for you, don't hesitate to DM me. I will find the time for the task.

I like music, videogames and open source software.
