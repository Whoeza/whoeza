**Hi there 👋 I want to show my talent and get hired as a Software\* Engineer 💻👑**

## My personal* roadmap
* I'm currently learning 🌎 Web* Development on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)
  * The idea is to start at 1️⃣ [Frontend development](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=html)
  * move on with 🎯 Backend development
  * and finish up with the Web as a ☝ Full Stack Developer

## Interests*
* [Python](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=python), C++, [Lua](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=lua), [Unity](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AWhoeza+unity), C#, Lisp, [Protobufs](https://github.com/Whoeza/protobufs-helloworld), [JSON](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q=json&type=&language=&sort=), Machine learning, Linux, Open source software, [HTML](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=html), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&language=javascript)
* Software development, eXtreme Programming, Agile, Scrum
* Getting hired for my talent as a developer and software engineer

## Past* experiences
* I attended Information Engineering university courses.
* I learned **C++**, **Java** and **Common Lisp** from textbooks. 🙄
* I had fun coding GTA V mods in FiveM for 2 months (until my PC burned down to hell 🔥) in **Lua**
* I began learning **Python** as a start with Data Science. I sticked to Python for its clean coding style and now I use it for everyday programming.
* **Current work**: I re-focused multiple times on several projects, until I decided:
  * > ### *Let's finish* **one** *project, before moving onto the next one*
  * Which brought me to [*Web\* Development*](https://whoeza.github.io/). It's a project to learn Front-end Development.
    * I'm learning [JavaScript](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&language=javascript) for it.
