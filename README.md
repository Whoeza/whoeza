### Hi there 👋
### I want to become a Software Engineer 👑💻
## My personal roadmap
### I'm currently learning 🌎 Web Development on freeCodeCamp
#### The idea is to start at Frontend development, move on with Backend development, and finish up with Full Stack Development
## Past experiences
### I had fun coding GTA V mods in FiveM for 2 months, until my PC burned down to hell 🔥
### I started learning Python to learn Data Science
### I re-focused multiple times on different ideas and projects, until I decided: let's finish **one** project before moving onto the next
#### So, here I am!
