**Hi there 👋 I want to show my talent and get [sponsored](https://github.com/sponsors/Whoeza) as a Software\* Engineer 💻👑**

## My personal* roadmap
* I'm currently learning 🌎 Web* Development on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)
  * The idea is to start with 1️⃣ [Front-end development](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=html)
    * On the way, I made a small package in Python call **html-and-py**, on [GitHub](https://github.com/Whoeza/html-and-py) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/html-and-py/)
  * move onto 🎯 Back-end development
  * and end up as a ☝ Full Stack Developer
  * 🤜 before finishing up as a Software* Engineer

This is my "home page" until I set up my personal website at [whoeza.github.io](https://whoeza.github.io)

## Interests*
* [Python](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=python), C++, [Lua](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q&language=lua), [Unity](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AWhoeza+unity), C#, Lisp, [Protobufs](https://github.com/Whoeza/protobufs-helloworld), [JSON](https://github.com/Whoeza?tab=repositories&q=json&type=&language=&sort=), Machine learning, Linux, Open source software, HTML, JavaScript
* Software development, eXtreme Programming, Agile, Scrum
* Getting hired for my talent as a developer and software engineer

## Past* experiences
* I had fun coding GTA V mods in FiveM for 2 months (until my PC burned down to hell 🔥) in **Lua**
* I began learning **Python** as a start with Data Science. I sticked to Python for its clean coding style and now I use it for everyday programming.
* **Current work**: I re-focused multiple times on several projects, until I decided:
  * > ### *Let's finish* **one** *project, before moving onto the next one*
  * Which brought me to [*Web\* Development*](https://whoeza.github.io/). It's a project to learn Front-end Development.
