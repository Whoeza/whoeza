# Welcome to my GitHub profile! :eyes:

**ðŸ‘‹ Hello!**

For privacy reasons, I have set my account to private. I will build a website to host my public profile. For now, you can browse my repositories directly from GitHub. Have fun! :)

My latest contribution is called [Source and license](https://github.com/Whoeza/source_and_license) and it allows to write a universal license header at the top of all your source code files.

## Contributions
If you have a small repository that I can help maintain, or a small feature that I could develop for you, don't hesitate to DM me. I am up for challenges.

Website under construction! You can point your smart-alert-and-or-notification-apps to the following page to know when it will come up. The current pages are a placeholder. Be patient... (: [whoeza.github.io](https://whoeza.github.io)

# Sponsoring (a.k.a. join my cause)
I had to resize my efforts in coding as I focus on the highest priority goal of getting a university degree. I have setup a sponsorship Tier to gather help with the corresponding education fees.

I could not believe the day I had my first sponsor here on GitHub! Here's my page: [github.com/sponsors/Whoeza](https://github.com/sponsors/Whoeza/)

Thank you:

**Special thanks to [@NicknameAlwaysTaken](https://github.com/NicknameAlwaystaken) for sharing the idea about GitHub sponsors.**
