# Welcome to my GitHub profile! :eyes:

**ðŸ‘‹ Hello!**

For privacy reasons, I have set my account to private. I will build a website to host my public profile. For now, you can browse my repositories directly from GitHub. Have fun! :)

My latest contribution is called "[Source and license](https://github.com/Whoeza/source_and_license)" and it allows to write a universal license header at the top of all your source code files.

## Contributions
If you have a small repository that I can help maintain, or a small feature that I could develop for you, don't hesitate to DM me. I am up for challenges.

I like food, music, open source software and videogames.

Website under construction! Be patient... (: [whoeza.github.io](https://whoeza.github.io)

## Sponsoring
I could not believe the day I had my first sponsor here on GitHub! Here's my page: [github.com/sponsors/Whoeza](https://github.com/sponsors/Whoeza/)
