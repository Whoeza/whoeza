**Hello! ðŸ‘‹** I am an engineering student with a full-time job, studying part-time to get my degree in computer science and information engineering.

I write in here to let you know that I would be available and willing to volunteer for open source projects.
If you have a small repository that I can help maintain, or a small feature that I could develop for you, don't hesitate to DM me. I will find the time for the task.

I like music, videogames and open source software.

One day I'll make a website... Be patient! (: [whoeza.github.io](https://whoeza.github.io)
